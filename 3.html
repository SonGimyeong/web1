            JavaScript</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled,
            object-oriented programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification
            JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orient
            ation, and first-class functions.

            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wi
            de Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web a
            pplications. The vast majority of websites use it,[12] and major web browsers have
            a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and im
            perative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It ha
            s APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but
            the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or grap
            hics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to pr
            ovide these features.

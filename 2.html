        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for 
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup l
        anguage like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the Wo
        rld Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and co
        ntent, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more 
        flexibility and cntrol in the specification of presentation cha
        racteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by 
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce 
        complexity and repetition in the structural content.
        
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to p
        resent the same markup page in different styles for different re
        ndering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via spee
        ch-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile 
        devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the cont
        ent is accessed on a mobile device.
        
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to d
        etermine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches 
        a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predicta
        ble.
        
        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Cons
        ortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is regist
        ered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates
         a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
        
        In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of C
        SS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
